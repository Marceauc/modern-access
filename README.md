TP TELECOM204 â€“ Coded Slotted Aloha (M. Coupechoux)
Subject

In this TP, we compute the asymptotic performance of coded slotted Aloha MAC protocols and we simulate one of its variants. For every question, there is a Python program to complete. You may add some text/code to explain your approach, comment the results or showing intermediate results. Please send me your code and responses in Jupyter-notebook format (yourname.ipynb) at marceau.coupechoux@telecom-paris.fr.
